# rpgpt-creator

Create a 'RPGPT Maker'. This is an RPG Maker application that uses Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Procedural Generation (PG), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to create 2D RPG games with a GUI. The application should have the ability to create entire games, including the logic, code, NPCs, societies, crafting, building, breeding, battling, personalities, memories, quests, etc. The application should have the ability to generate maps, and asset images, such as map tiles, items, weapons, character sprites, etc. 

Additionally consider all aspects that go into an RPG game. The 'RPGPT Maker' application should be fully equipped to build a fully functional 2D RPG that a human can play. It should also be fully equipped to build a fully functional 2D RPG simulation where the entire adaptable game world is populated by AI agents, with a GUI to watch the simulation unfold.
